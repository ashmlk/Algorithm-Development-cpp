##pow(x, y) implementation for comparing different divide and conquer algorithms

* First algorithm is a naive approach to solving the problem using recursion
* Second algorithm saves the sub-problem state to reduce run time

We can see that the algorithm consumes less time when we use the second approach and it runs in O(log n)
